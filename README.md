# Petko-Data-Science-Portfolio

Welcome to my Data Science Portfolio! This repository is a collection of my data science projects, analyses, and visualizations that showcase my skills and learning. The purpose of this repository is to document and share my work in data science, including exploratory data analysis (EDA), data visualization, and other models I have built.

## Repository Structure

The portfolio will be organized as follows to keep the content well-structured and easy to navigate:

1. **EDA**: This folder will contain the initial data exploration for each project, including data cleaning, transformation, and basic analysis.
2. **Visualizations**: Here, I will store all the visualizations created during the project, such as charts, graphs, and plots.
3. **Models**: This folder will include the models developed for each project.
4. **Docs**: This section will contain any documentation or reports related to the project, such as insights, conclusions, or further steps.

## Future Plans

As I continue to learn and grow in data science, I will be adding new projects to this portfolio. Each project will showcase different aspects of data science that I am working on.

Feel free to explore, provide feedback, and check back for new projects as I update my portfolio!


## Contents
- [**Basic Streamlit App (Automobile Database):**](https://github.com/zpetko63/Petko-Data-Science-Portfolio/tree/main/basic_streamlit_app) This streamlit app built in python lets users explore and filter the automobile database bsed on their desired criteria. The user has the ability to choose between MPG, Number of Cylinders, Horsepower, or just the unfiltered data set to narrow down results.
  
- [**TidyData-Project (Federal Departmental Spending):**](https://github.com/zpetko63/Petko-Data-Science-Portfolio/tree/main/TidyData-Project) In this python jupyter notebook, I cleaned and analyzed federal R&D spending data using pandas and matplotlib. I transformed the dataset into a tidy format and created visualizations to explore departmental spending trends. A pivot table summarizes median spending over the years. This project showcases my skills in data cleaning, analysis, and visualization.

- [**Supervised Machine Learning Streamlit App:**](https://github.com/zpetko63/Petko-Data-Science-Portfolio/tree/main/MLStreamlitApp) This Streamlit app allows users to train, tune, and evaluate various machine learning models on a dataset of their choice. Users can upload their own dataset or select from built-in datasets like the Breast Cancer dataset. The app includes features for model selection (Logistic Regression or Decision Tree), hyperparameter tuning, and performance evaluation through metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC curves. It also provides visualizations like decision tree plots for better interpretation.

- [**Unsupervised Machine Learning Streamlit App:**](https://github.com/zpetko63/Petko-Data-Science-Portfolio/tree/main/MLUnsupervisedApp) This Streamlit web application allows users to interactively explore and analyze datasets using unsupervised machine learning techniques. The app supports both a built-in 2025 NFL Draft dataset and user uploads, enabling dimensionality reduction with PCA, clustering using K-Means and Hierarchical Clustering, and visualization of results in a 2D PCA space with evaluation metrics and dendrograms. This project showcases practical data science skills in building interactive tools and applying fundamental unsupervised algorithms to uncover patterns in data.
