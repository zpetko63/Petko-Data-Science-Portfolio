# Petko-Data-Science-Portfolio

Welcome to my Data Science Portfolio! This repository is a collection of my data science projects, analyses, and visualizations that showcase my skills and learning. The purpose of this repository is to document and share my work in data science, including exploratory data analysis (EDA), data visualization, and other models I have built.

## Repository Structure

The portfolio will be organized as follows to keep the content well-structured and easy to navigate:

1. **EDA**: This folder will contain the initial data exploration for each project, including data cleaning, transformation, and basic analysis.
2. **Visualizations**: Here, I will store all the visualizations created during the project, such as charts, graphs, and plots.
3. **Models**: This folder will include the models developed for each project.
4. **Docs**: This section will contain any documentation or reports related to the project, such as insights, conclusions, or further steps.

## Future Plans

As I continue to learn and grow in data science, I will be adding new projects to this portfolio. Each project will showcase different aspects of data science that I am working on.

Feel free to explore, provide feedback, and check back for new projects as I update my portfolio!


## Contents
- **Basic Streamlit App (Automobile Database):** This streamlit app built in python lets users explore and filter the automobile database bsed on their desired criteria. The user has the ability to choose between MPG, Number of Cylinders, Horsepower, or just the unfiltered data set to narrow down results.
  
- **TidyData-Project (Federal Departmental Spending):** In this python jupyter notebook, I cleaned, tidied, and analyzed a dataset on federal Research and Development (R&D) spending across various departments and years. Using pandas, I transformed the raw dataset into a tidy format by renaming columns, reshaping the data with melting techniques, and converting data types for better analysis. I created insightful visualizations using matplotlib, including a time series line chart to explore spending trends over time and a bar chart to analyze departmental spending shares for specific years. Additionally, I developed a pivot table to summarize median departmental spending across years, providing valuable insights into funding patterns and policy impacts. This project highlights my ability to clean, manipulate, and visualize real-world data, enhancing my data analysis and storytelling skills.
