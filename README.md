# Petko-Data-Science-Portfolio

Welcome to my Data Science Portfolio! This repository is a collection of my data science projects, analyses, and visualizations that showcase my skills and learning. The purpose of this repository is to document and share my work in data science, including exploratory data analysis (EDA), data visualization, and other models I have built.

## Repository Structure

The portfolio will be organized as follows to keep the content well-structured and easy to navigate:

1. **EDA**: This folder will contain the initial data exploration for each project, including data cleaning, transformation, and basic analysis.
2. **Visualizations**: Here, I will store all the visualizations created during the project, such as charts, graphs, and plots.
3. **Models**: This folder will include the models developed for each project.
4. **Docs**: This section will contain any documentation or reports related to the project, such as insights, conclusions, or further steps.

## Future Plans

As I continue to learn and grow in data science, I will be adding new projects to this portfolio. Each project will showcase different aspects of data science that I am working on.

Feel free to explore, provide feedback, and check back for new projects as I update my portfolio!
